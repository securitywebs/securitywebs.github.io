<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to find any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensing units to disregard things that exert percentages of pressure on the wires.
