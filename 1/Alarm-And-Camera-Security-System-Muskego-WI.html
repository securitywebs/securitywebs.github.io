<p>After checking dozens of wired and wireless alternatives, the best home security camera for many people is the Arlo Pro 2. It records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is completely wireless, and can be established both indoors and out, as it's weather condition resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have a contract, and its equipment prices is extremely affordable, so it's not a total splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the similarity Vivint or Brinks.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
