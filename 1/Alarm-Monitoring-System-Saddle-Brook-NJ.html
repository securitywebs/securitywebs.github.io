Dependability has long been at the heart of the dispute over wireless versus hardwired home security systems. It's an argument that's often skewed by elements such as uncertainty over the vulnerability of wireless systems, consisting of disturbance from radio signals and glitches that cause false alarms. While enhancements in the last few years have made the technology more popular and robust (some systems today have their own distinct wireless technology, which can't be hindered by other signals), issues continue over vulnerabilities that do not impact hardwired systems.</p>
<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, usually referred to as shock sensing units, are different in that they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which travel through the glass and typically through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Typically, the most intense frequencies produced are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the kind of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>
