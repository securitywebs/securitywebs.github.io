<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to sign in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We initially observed Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we attempted it out, it rapidly ended up being a personnel (and friends and family) favorite. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send informs, you can't control it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>

The camera consists of functions like complimentary streamable HD video and audio, 30-day storage, and night vision, but it does not take pictures of activity and can't pan or move-- basic features found on most surveillance cameras. </p>
