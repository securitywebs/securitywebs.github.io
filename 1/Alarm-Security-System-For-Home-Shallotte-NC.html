<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between people and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>
