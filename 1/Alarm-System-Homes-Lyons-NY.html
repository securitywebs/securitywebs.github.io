<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that distinguish between people and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>
