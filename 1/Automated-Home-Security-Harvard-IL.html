<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
<p>Equipment consists of things like your door and window sensing units, motion sensors, control panel, etc. The cost absolutely depends upon which provider you choose, however expect to pay a few hundred dollars for a basic plan--$ 200 would be considered cheap for a starter pack of home security equipment.
