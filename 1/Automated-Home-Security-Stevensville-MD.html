<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that compare individuals and basic motion.

There are a handful of companies that use totally free video storage, but the video is sent to a cloud account and only kept for a few days. For longer access to video, anticipate to pay a monthly storage cost.</p>
