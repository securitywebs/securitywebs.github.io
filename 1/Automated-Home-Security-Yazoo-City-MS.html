<p>The Frontpoint Security system, along with its Interactive plan, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and features are nearly identical to those of the Brinks system.

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the large amount of information required by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and typically over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are dependable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for more electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less circuitry in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera independently, normally through 110VAC power. </p>
