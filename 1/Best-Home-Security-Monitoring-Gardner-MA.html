<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can determine individuals the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment.

We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also supply a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
