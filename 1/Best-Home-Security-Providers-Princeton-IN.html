When they discover motion, the alarm sounds and you'll receive an alert. Rest assured, if there's any motion or commotion, you'll be the very first to understand. The very best motion detectors can distinguish between animals and individuals, and some even boast facial recognition technology.</p>
<p>Some property owners post decoy alarm signs hoping they'll discourage prospective intruders.

<h2>How Do I Install A Wireless Video Surveillance System Princeton</h2>
<p>Analog security cameras transmit lower resolution video over coax cable television and record to a Digital Video Recorder (DVR) which can manage such things as scheduling, motion detection, and digital zoom. The DVR transforms the analog signal to digital, compresses it, and after that shops it on a hard disk for later retrieval. Displays can be linked to the DVR for viewing, or the system can be set up to interact through network or mobile app for seeing.</p>
<p>IP security cameras record analog images and transform them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing abilities like compression and motion detection. The captured digital video stream is then transmitted over a local area network (LAN) using Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which records each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and review. The system can be set up to communicate through network or mobile app for seeing.</p>
