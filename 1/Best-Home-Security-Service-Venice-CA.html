<p>If you do come across a home intrusion emergency, you can set off the 80dB alarm. I am slightly disappointed by the volume of the alarm.

To hold and recoup costs alarm companies accountable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company rather of with you. Your alarm company need to be licensed, pay any registration or incorrect alarm fees, and provide physical proof like camera footage or a damaged window to require police action.</p>
