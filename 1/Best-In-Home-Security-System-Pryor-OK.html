<p>Vivint Outdoor Camera Pro: As security system cameras go, the Vivint Outdoor Camera Pro is among the best-- and it will deal with the rest of your Vivint system. The small, black orb of a dome camera offers a better field of view than its bullet counterpart. It's also more subtle, more durable kinds of security cameras on the market.

Having the ability to distinguish between a car and an individual, for example, permits you to cut down on unnecessary informs. And Activity Zones are a good perk, specifically if you're wanting to monitor a particular corner of the lawn, an entrance, or perhaps garbage cans. </p>
