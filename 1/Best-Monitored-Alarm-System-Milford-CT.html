<p>Recently, Ring rejected reports that it had actually suffered a data breach, however we agree with its suggestion that users should reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a preventive measure. All smart-home devices are vulnerable to such events. Nevertheless, after this most current entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have actually chosen to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? area from our smart video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video items, we do not think that these issues modify the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay confident in our present recommendation.</p>
