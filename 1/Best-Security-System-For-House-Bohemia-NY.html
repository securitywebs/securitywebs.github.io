<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that distinguish between people and general motion. We think that's pricey.</p>

<p>The cost of admission for the Deep Sentinel Home Security system isn't that high, even at $499, because it includes three outdoor cameras with two-way audio. And the $50-per-month subscription cost sounds costly, however it's not a lot when you consider that a live human being is viewing a live feed whenever the cameras detect suspicious activity. That person at Deep Guard's center can warn a suspicious person that they're being observed, and they can call your local police dispatcher if they decline to leave or engage in a criminal act.

<p>We do not suggest the SmartThings SmartCam due to the fact that it's more complex than it should be. Recordings, informs, and combination all need different IFTTT-style rules.
