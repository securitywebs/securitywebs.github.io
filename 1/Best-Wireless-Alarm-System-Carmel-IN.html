<p>Your CCTV camera might make you feel physically safer, however after reading this post, it will sure make you feel practically susceptible. A few minutes into the Do It Yourself installation, our tester got stuck getting her control board up and online-- it simply would not connect. An aid window appeared with a number to call, and a Frontpoint rep helped her troubleshoot the connection. After about 10 minutes, he could inform there was an issue with the circuit board. Certainly not perfect-- but the representative asked forgiveness and delivered her replacement control panel overnight.</p>
<p>After testing dozens of wired and wireless alternatives, the best home security camera for most people is the Arlo Pro 2. It records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is fully wireless, and can be set up both inside and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have an agreement, and its equipment rates is incredibly sensible, so it's not a total splurge. However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large quantity of data required by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and often over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trusted, however not compatible with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the need for further wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may require less circuitry in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera individually, normally through 110VAC power. </p>
