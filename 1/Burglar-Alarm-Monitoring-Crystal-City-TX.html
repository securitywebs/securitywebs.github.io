<p>To evaluate response times for the monitoring company, we triggered each system a minimum of 5 times, utilizing contact and motion sensors. Nevertheless, bear in mind that the monitoring company's response time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls must be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs confirmation from a private security guard. A number of cities likewise need an authorization to even own and run a home security system.

<p>IP security cameras catch analog images and transform them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing capabilities like compression and motion detection. The caught digital video stream is then relayed over a local area network (LAN) utilizing Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which catches each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and review. The system can be established to interact by means of network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
<p>Setting up a total home security system has never ever been this easy or economical.

You can even include wireless video surveillance and get central-station monitoring for about half of what professional alarm companies charge.</p>
