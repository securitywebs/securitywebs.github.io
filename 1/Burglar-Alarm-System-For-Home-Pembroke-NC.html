<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has clearly tried to provide it an attractive edge, and we have to provide credit to its capability to show what's going on from up to 4 cameras at a time. It can be slow and awkward to utilize on event - with the process of connecting to the camera for a live view rather sluggish at times. The previous, cheaper version of the outdoor Nest cam is still on sale too if you wish to save some money - it does have a cable television connected however, instead of working wirelessly, which means it's a bit easier to sabotage for prospective trespassers.
