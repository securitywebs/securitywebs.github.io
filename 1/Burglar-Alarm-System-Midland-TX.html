And that's what Nest gives you.</p>
<p>Alder uses superior home security that's 100% wire-free. The DIY systems can be set up in a matter of minutes.

The Wi-Fi Alliance recently revealed its next-generation wireless network security requirement which intends to solve a common security problem: open Wi-Fi networks.

With the quality of the equipment that is offered today, it's safe to say that the wireless systems are just as good, if not much better, than the wired systems.
