<h2>Advantages Of CCTV Dome Cameras Oakland</h2>
<p>In the past, a surveillance security system usually consisted of a number of cameras linked-- either hardwired or wireless-- to a digital video recorder (DVR), which recorded the images and showed them on a closed circuit tv (CCTV) or monitor. Nowadays, it's a lot easier to have a standalone security camera.
