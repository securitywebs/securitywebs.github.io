<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize people the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those people and will send out smart device informs with that info when they appear at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also provide a wider variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
