<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that compare individuals and general motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
