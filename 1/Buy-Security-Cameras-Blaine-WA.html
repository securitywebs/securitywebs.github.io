For beginners, it looks stunning: the all-white style and black camera face are seriously spacey (if eerily reminiscent of the AI in 2001: An Area Odyssey).

<p>Recently, Ring rejected reports that it had actually suffered an information breach, but we agree with its recommendation that users must reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a preventive procedure. All smart-home gadgets are susceptible to such events. However, after this newest entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have decided to pull our suggestion of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially check out the What about Ring? section from our wise video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it concerns video items, we do not believe that these concerns change the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain positive in our existing recommendation.</p>
