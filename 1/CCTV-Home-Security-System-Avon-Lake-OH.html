<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to check in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We initially saw Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we attempted it out, it quickly ended up being a staff (and family and friends) favorite.
