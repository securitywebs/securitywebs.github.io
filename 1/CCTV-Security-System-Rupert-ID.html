Or ... no monitoring costs at all if you select the complimentary self-monitor" option.</p>
<p>During our testing, this compact camera recorded sharp, 1080p HD images day and night, and its digital zoom was useful for taking a more detailed look. We especially like this camera's broad, 180-degree field of view, since you're less likely to get a blind spot wherever you set it up. For less than $400, you get 2 door and window sensing units, one motion detector, and a video doorbell with two-way talk.</p>

<p>Dome IP camera, as the name suggests, is a type of CCTV camera with a dome cover. However beyond that I just had problems.
