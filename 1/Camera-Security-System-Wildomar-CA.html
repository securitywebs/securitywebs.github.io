<p>Nothing is more important than safeguarding what you treasure most ... your household and home. The implicit justification for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the danger of terrorist attacks. However suicide aggressors are plainly not prevented by video cameras - and might even be drawn in to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the expenditure of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up around 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget plan - far exceeds the minimal benefits that the system might supply in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the fact (see truth sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
