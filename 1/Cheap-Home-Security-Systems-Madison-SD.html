<p>Your CCTV camera may make you feel physically more secure, however after reading this short article, it will sure make you feel practically susceptible. A couple of minutes into the Do It Yourself installation, our tester got stuck getting her control panel up and online-- it simply wouldn't connect. An aid window popped up with a number to call, and a Frontpoint rep helped her troubleshoot the connection. After about 10 minutes, he might tell there was an issue with the circuit board. Certainly not ideal-- but the associate apologized and delivered her replacement control board over night.</p>
