The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had actually installed on the porch by a certified electrician (who takes place to be my hubby). All of the cameras were linked to the same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router indoors (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to your home was Verizon Fios.</p>

Our tester stated the service technician supplied solid customer care: He dropped a couple of unnecessary window sensing units from my bill after choosing that the motion detector was sufficient for the whole front half of my home."
