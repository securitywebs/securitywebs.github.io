<p>6 basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Asset protection devices are designed to protect specific, concrete assets, such as jewelry, paintings, money boxes, and household treasures. These devices can be outfitted with anti-tampering technology to prevent being deactivated. If the item to which the device has actually been connected is moved or interrupted, the sensing unit will trigger an alarm.</p>

<p>Bullet cameras are one of the two most common CCTV camera types. They have a long cylindrical shape, providing their name and a distinct appearance. This look is recognizable to nearly everyone and thus acts as a deterrent to undesirable individuals. If security cameras are visible, the hope is intruders and lawbreakers go elsewhere instead. That being stated, bullet cameras are more prone to vandalism because of their apparent look. Additionally, the shape of the camera is perfect for focusing on a set field, such as an entry or exit, but needs multiple cameras if a user needs to see numerous fixed views. Bullet cameras are quickly mountable and can work inside your home or outdoors. They include a small lip on completion of the camera that includes weather condition protection and lowers glare.</p>
