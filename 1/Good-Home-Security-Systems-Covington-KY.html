<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it provides protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to discover it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just an incorrect sense of security given that it prevents only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>

<p>Many burglars enter your home or business when you aren't around. The come during the day, when you're most likely to be at work or running errands.
