<p>The Ring Alarm system also has a self-monitoring option, something that's unheard of amongst professionally set up systems. That implies even if you do not pay the month-to-month fee, the system will still alert you through your smartphone if it identifies a hazard, however you are responsible for calling emergency services such as the police or fire department-- so your phone requires to remain on and you need to be happy to field informs, even at 2:00 a.m. It's great that the system has a monitoring option, though, in case you don't constantly want that obligation, such as when you're on vacation.</p>
<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
<p>When I eventually got into the camera controls, I was fairly impressed. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a solid night-vision mode, and all the app controls are fairly obvious. You have actually got two-way audio, you can play melodies just to let the person being viewed know they're being seen, and you can pick to tape video clips or images and conserve them to your clever device on an impulse. </p>
