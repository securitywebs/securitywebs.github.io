<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a harmful opponent, since the disturbance of the network avoids the circulation of data and really indirectly safeguards data by preventing it from being transmitted. The usual factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, supplying an opportunity for the malicious enemy to record these codes and utilize various breaking tools to examine security weaknesses and exploit them to gain unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can introduce a dictionary style attack of "possibly accepted" security keys based on the "design" security key recorded throughout the network recovery.</p>
<p>The prevalence of video surveillance systems as a service (VSSaaS) solution has actually surged in the last few years.
