<p>Ring may not be the most advanced system on our list (Vivint takes that reward), but it sure has gained quite the fanfare throughout the years. We've been evaluating Ring Alarm a fair bit recently, and we in fact like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a prepackaged security set that uses basic intrusion protection with super-low monthly monitoring costs. Or ... no monitoring costs at all if you pick the free self-monitor" alternative.</p>
<p>Are alarms a effective and efficient  method to catch robbers? Although burglary stays among the most often reported criminal offenses, the clearance rate for U.S. break-ins has remained listed below 15 percent for many years. 14 Clearly, whatever contribution alarm system are making to resolving burglary cases is modest, at best.

Unfortunately, history has actually shown that surveillance innovations put in place for one function inevitably broaden into other usages. And with video innovation likely to continue advancing, the absence of any clear limits for what CCTV systems should be able to do poses a substantial risk.</p>

Clients can pick anything from standard monitoring to full-on home security automation, with the ideal mix of services and gizmos to fit their needs. </p>
