<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally regular because the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as clients realize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
