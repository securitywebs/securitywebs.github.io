<p>Nevermind how terrific the cameras are. The first question you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your data to 3rd party companies? I have actually dumped my Nest Cams given that they were purchased by Google. Something we all require to think about. Sirens. So your camera has spotted trespassers or wild animals. Do you wish to scare them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will do the trick. Keep in mind that these sirens may violate local noise control laws, so examine ahead of time before making the purchase.</p>
<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
<p>We liked Alder for their fast response times and overall flexibility. And controlling our system with their touchscreen panel was pretty darn and effortless smooth.

Given all of the other advantages, it's simple to see why numerous people are choosing this alternative. </p>
