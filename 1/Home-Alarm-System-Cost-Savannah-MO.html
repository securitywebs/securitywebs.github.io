<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids consulting with someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is activated. Let's face it, false alarms are fairly common. If a property owner forgets their keys and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is set off by a neighborhood feline, it can set off the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the homeowner will be called by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it rapidly. False alarms take place. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner will not receive calls from a monitoring company. Instead, homeowners access the alarm themselves and take the necessary action.</p>

<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a quick explanation of how thermal cameras work: All items emit infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature.

A thermal camera includes a heat sensor that is capable of detecting small differences in temperature level. The gadget collects the infrared radiation from things in the scene and develops an electronic image based upon information about the temperature distinctions. Because things are rarely precisely the same temperature as other objects around them, a thermal camera can detect them, and they will look like unique in a thermal image.</p>
