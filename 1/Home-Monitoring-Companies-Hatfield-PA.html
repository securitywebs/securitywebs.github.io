So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no concept I was in, to get out I have to pay $783.  Really frustrating. Once again the sales individuals, or a minimum of mine, do not discuss the 3 year dedication. I called their customer service group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to discuss it, it's on you to read the small print. I'm paying the swelling amount, since obviously they auto restore you eventually unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send out in a composed not by mail.  ADT is a headache, way too pricey, and not excellent.</p>
