The team will be able to recycle the existing circuitry if you've currently installed a wired system in the past and you are upgrading to a new system.

Although FrontPoint uses a wide variety of equipment and home automation items at a sensible price, the one location where the company particularly stands out remains in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
