<p>The Hive View provides fantastic 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation set off too easily, even when on the lowest sensitivity setting.

We also experienced above-average connectivity issues, with 2 Hive test units detaching 8 times over 2 months.</p>
<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a harmful assailant, since the interruption of the network prevents the flow of information and actually indirectly secures information by preventing it from being sent. The typical factor for performing a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, offering a chance for the destructive assailant to tape-record these codes and use various splitting tools to examine security weak points and exploit them to get unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools offered which can introduce a dictionary style attack of "perhaps accepted" security secrets based upon the "model" security key recorded throughout the network recovery.</p>
