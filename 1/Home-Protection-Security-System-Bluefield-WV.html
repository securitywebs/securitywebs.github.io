We advise the 8-piece security package as the best method to optimize Ring's cost effective home security choices due to the fact that we understand all the ins and outs of Ring Alarm. Unless you just have one door and one window, you'll need more than the only contact sensing unit that can be found in Ring's five-piece kit.</p>
