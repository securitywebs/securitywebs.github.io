All in all, Vivint is an excellent provider of state-of-the-art security systems and home automation technology if customers can afford the high equipment cost, though choosing the 60-month financing plan can lighten the burden somewhat.</p>
<p>A system that needs a contract might be a clever option for those who are cash-strapped or don't wish to pay for the equipment up-front. Why?

We have actually seen 1-year, all the way up to 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you don't want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting agreement (and who does?). Our pick: No agreement.</p>
