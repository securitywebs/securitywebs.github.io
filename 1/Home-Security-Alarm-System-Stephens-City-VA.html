As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical because the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
