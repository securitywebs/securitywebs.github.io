It's far from the ghastly metal CCTV box that you may call to mind when you envision a home security camera. The first wireless function to consider is the security system and its components, and how they all connect. In the past, every monitoring component was hard-wired back to a panel box. This indicated every door and window required its own wire and course of holes through your house.</p>
