<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
