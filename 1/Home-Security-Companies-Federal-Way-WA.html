<p>Wireless sensors protect all points of entry. Light, discreet & easy to place up to 200ft. from the panel.

<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've discovered that battery life never matches the producer's statistics because this comes from tests in a regulated environment without constant video recording, which is the biggest culprit for brief battery life by far. We concur with you about Blink's superior battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, however its recording capability is a bit minimal to suggest as a top pick.</p>
<p>During our testing, this compact camera tape-recorded sharp, 1080p HD images day and night, and its digital zoom was useful for taking a closer look. We particularly like this camera's large, 180-degree field of view, because you're less likely to get a blind spot wherever you set it up. For less than $400, you get two door and window sensing units, one motion detector, and a video doorbell with two-way talk.</p>
