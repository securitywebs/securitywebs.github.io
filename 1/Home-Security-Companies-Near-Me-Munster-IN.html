Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just an incorrect complacency considering that it prevents only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
