<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it supplies protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to detect it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just an incorrect complacency considering that it prevents only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>

<p>Wireless security cameras take advantage of your home or organisations WiFi connection to develop a surveillance network.
