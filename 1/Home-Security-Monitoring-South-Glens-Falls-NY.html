<p>If you do encounter a home invasion emergency, you can trigger the 80dB alarm. I am somewhat dissatisfied by the volume of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food processor whereas numerous other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB or even 105dB. Regardless of that, the alarm must be enough to frighten intruders for the most part. To recoup costs and hold alarm companies liable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company must be licensed, pay any registration or incorrect alarm fees, and supply physical evidence like camera video footage or a damaged window to necessitate police response.</p>

<p>Bullet cameras are among the 2 most common CCTV camera types. They have a long round shape, providing their name and an unique appearance. This look is recognizable to nearly everyone and thus serves as a deterrent to unwanted people. The hope is burglars and lawbreakers go elsewhere instead if security cameras are visible. That being said, bullet cameras are more prone to vandalism since of their obvious look. Additionally, the shape of the camera is perfect for focusing on a fixed field, such as an entry or exit, but requires multiple cameras if a user needs to see numerous fixed views.
