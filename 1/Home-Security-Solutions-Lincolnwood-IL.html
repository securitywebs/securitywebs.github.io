<p>In The Sims 2, a burglar alarm will cover the entire room it is positioned in. Burglar alarms can not be positioned outdoors, unless the moveobjects cheat is used.

<p>While most service providers provide you the alternative to include both indoor and outdoor cameras to your security package, SimpliSafe's choice is restricted to one indoor surveillance camera. The camera includes features like free streamable HD video and audio, 30-day storage, and night vision, but it doesn't take pictures of activity and can't move or pan-- basic features found on the majority of surveillance cameras. </p>
