<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we could point them at the very same area and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting components, which I had installed on the deck by a certified electrical expert (who occurs to be my spouse). All of the cameras were connected to the same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router indoors (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>When your camera are set up, you can choose whether or not your cameras will be monitored by the main station. If you pick to have your cameras monitored (this is usually done for cameras that are monitoring outdoor locations), then yes, main station operators will see the video that is taped when an alarm is triggered. Nevertheless, you might choose to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is usually provided for cameras that are monitoring indoor, suburbs). Cameras that are not monitored by the main station can not be accessed our operators for any reason, even if requested by the consumer. </p>
