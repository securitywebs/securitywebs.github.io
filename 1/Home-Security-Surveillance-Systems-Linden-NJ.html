<h3>Surveillance Camera System Linden NJ 07036</h3>
<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to check in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We first saw Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it quickly became a personnel (and friends and family) favorite. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker.
