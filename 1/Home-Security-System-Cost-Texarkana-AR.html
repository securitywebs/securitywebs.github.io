<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it offers protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software to identify it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just an incorrect sense of security because it avoids only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
