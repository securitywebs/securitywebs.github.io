<h3>Home Security System Monitoring in Washington</h3>

<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can identify people the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those people and will send mobile phone alerts with that info when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
