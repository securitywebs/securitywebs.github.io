<p>Cost: Smart alarm can be cheaper since customers avoid paying somebody else to install or monitor them. False alarms often disrupt neighbors. Alarms with outside ringers typically disrupt homes great distances from the instant neighborhood. Neighbors, whom they are suggested to inform, often neglect the alarm.</p>
<p>IP security cameras capture analog images and transform them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing abilities like compression and motion detection. The caught digital video stream is then transmitted over a local area network (LAN) using Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable television to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which records each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and review. The system can be set up to communicate through network or mobile app for seeing.</p>
