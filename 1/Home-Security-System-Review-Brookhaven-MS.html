<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>
