ADT uses monitored security packages that are customized to protect your home. Highlight consist of the ability control your home security system from anywhere, set up custom signals, supply live video monitoring (both outside and inside), in addition to emergency alarms activated by smoke, co2, and even flooding.</p>

Without it, you won't get the person-detection feature, adjustable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera identified activity. Having the ability to distinguish between an automobile and an individual, for instance, enables you to cut down on unnecessary alerts. And Activity Zones are a great perk, especially if you're seeking to monitor a particular corner of the yard, an entrance, or perhaps garbage cans. </p>
