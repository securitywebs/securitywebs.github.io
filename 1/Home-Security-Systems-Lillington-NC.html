<p>For these different systems to converge or to integrate them together into a single user interface, an in-depth understanding of all the needed systems is needed. If there are no as-built files providing performance and setup details to make this integration work, there are only two options. The first option, which might be the most complex, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original solution provider is unwilling or not available to provide those information) and record the geography and how they can be included into the new DVS system. The other approach is to rip and change, carrying out a complete upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to assemble them all.</p>
<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most highly sophisticated outdoor camera we have actually checked. It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare basic motion and people, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even identify individuals you have actually identified (after a knowing period). But like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>So what takes place if something activates your alarm however you're in a meeting with a supplier and you do not get the alert? Or what if you've lastly gone on a much-needed trip and your spotty cell service implies you don't get alerted up until the next day? If your system equipment includes an audible alarm, the noise might scare off prospective intruders-- if you're lucky. But the authorities will not come till you personally call them. </p>
