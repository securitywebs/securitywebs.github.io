<p>If you do encounter a home intrusion emergency, you can trigger the 80dB alarm. I am slightly disappointed by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it has to do with as loud as a food processor whereas lots of other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB or even 105dB. In spite of that, the alarm needs to suffice to scare away intruders in most cases. To recover costs and hold alarm companies liable for false alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company need to be licensed, pay any registration or incorrect alarm fees, and offer physical proof like camera video footage or a damaged window to require cops reaction.</p>
