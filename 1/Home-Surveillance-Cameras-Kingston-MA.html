<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced features, such as notifications that compare individuals and general motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
