<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to detect any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a basic mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to neglect objects that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is installed to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
