Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and functions are almost identical to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's plans are somewhat more pricey for the same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation charges are difficult, and its rates is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer suggest anyhow.</p>
