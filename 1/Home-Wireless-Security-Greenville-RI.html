<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, the majority of burglar alarms work the exact same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electric existing. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If somebody were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the alarm system. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door allows for the electrical existing to flow throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the alarm system will trigger.</p>
