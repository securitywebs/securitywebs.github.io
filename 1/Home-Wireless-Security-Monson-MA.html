<p>Nevermind how terrific the cameras are. The very first question you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your information to 3rd party companies? I've dumped my Nest Cams given that they were bought by Google. Something we all require to think of. Sirens. So your camera has actually spotted trespassers or wild animals. Do you want to scare them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will do the trick. Keep in mind that these sirens might violate local sound control laws, so inspect ahead of time prior to making the purchase.</p>
<p>For all the advantages of Nest Secure, the quality of customer care is not one of them.
