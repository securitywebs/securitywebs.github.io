Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to disregard things that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires.
