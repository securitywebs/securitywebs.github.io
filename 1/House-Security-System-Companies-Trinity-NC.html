<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal considering that the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone entering the store.
