These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
