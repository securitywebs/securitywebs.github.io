As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular considering that the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
