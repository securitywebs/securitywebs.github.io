<p>Some people would rather pay an alarm company the regular monthly monitoring rate rather of buying a self-monitored security system.

For the majority of homes, you'll need several Minuts throughout your home, which can get costly. It's also worth keeping in mind that it has to be installed on the ceiling (it only keeps track of for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly.
