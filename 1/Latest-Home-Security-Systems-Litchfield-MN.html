But suicide enemies are clearly not discouraged by camera - and may even be drawn in to the tv protection cameras can guarantee - and the expenditure of a substantial video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up around 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice spending plan - far goes beyond the restricted benefits that the system may provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the truth (see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>Cameras frequently broadcast video footage over the Internet, enabling operators to monitor security camera feeds from another location.
