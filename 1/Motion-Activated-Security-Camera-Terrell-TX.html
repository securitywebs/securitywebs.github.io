<p>Nothing is more important than securing what you treasure most ... your family and home. The implicit validation for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the threat of terrorist attacks. However suicide opponents are plainly not deterred by camera - and might even be brought in to the television protection cameras can ensure - and the expenditure of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up approximately 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget plan - far goes beyond the minimal benefits that the system may provide in investigating attacks or tried attacks after the truth (see truth sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, generally described as shock sensors, are different because they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which travel through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Generally, the most extreme frequencies created are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the kind of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>

Indirectly I can see his point, I have actually been playing video games for a very long time and a lot of the stuff in earlier video games I've played a decade ago would definitely NEVER make it in todays politically charged gaming environment.</p>
