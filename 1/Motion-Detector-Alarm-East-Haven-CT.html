<p>Seattle's main intent with this law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies more liable for false alarms, and reduce the number of unneeded cops and fire reactions.

<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by an expert home security company.

And with video technology likely to continue advancing, the lack of any clear borders for what CCTV systems ought to be able to do positions a substantial danger.</p>
<p>So why don't we rank ADT greater? In some ways, ADT annoys us. We see numerous growing companies branching out and attempting new things in the home security space. But ADT isn't keeping up. It costs a lot, its rates isn't always transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to discuss that the client service experience differs extensively depending upon the dealership you opt for. </p>
