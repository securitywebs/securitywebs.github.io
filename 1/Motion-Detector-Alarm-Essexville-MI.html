<p>Condominium associations might prohibit citizens from drilling holes in outside walls. Residents of these houses might be better off using a wireless security system. Wireless alarms are likewise perfect for renters, as they can take the system with them when they move. Property owners, on the other hand, have a much higher degree of option. They can choose wired or wireless systems without much hassle.</p>
<p>The disadvantage to a wireless system is that it depends on a wireless signal, implying that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and could even activate false alarms. False alarms are known to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might result in fines from the provider or the cops if they happen frequently enough. Another potential downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool should be replaced or charged frequently in order to keep the system working.
