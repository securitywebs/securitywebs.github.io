Window sensors don't protect against somebody smashing through big glass windows or sliding glass doors and walking through it. Glass break detectors, on the other hand, acknowledge the noises produced by breaking glass and alert your home security company.</p>
<p>In addition to the system itself, security alarms are often paired with a monitoring service. In the event of an alarm, the facilities manage system contacts a main monitoring station. Operators at the station see the signal and take proper action, such as calling homeowner, alerting authorities, or dispatching personal security forces.

In spite of a basic enhancement in wireless technology, there appear to be less ways for hardwired systems to be disrupted and disarmed. </p>
