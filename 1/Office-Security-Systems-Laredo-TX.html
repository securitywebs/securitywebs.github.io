<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak with an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimal efficiency. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near the NVR is absolutely something to be taken into consideration.

It turned out to be a false alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>
