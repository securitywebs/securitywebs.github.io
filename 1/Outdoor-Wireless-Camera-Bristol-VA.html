If a property owner forgets their keys and goes back within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is triggered by a community cat, it can set off the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the homeowner will be contacted by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it quickly. False alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a house owner won't get calls from a monitoring company. Rather, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the essential action.</p>
