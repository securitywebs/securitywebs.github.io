<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large quantity of data required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and frequently over long distances.

Wireless security cameras may need less electrical wiring in the walls however will still need cables to power the security camera individually, normally by means of 110VAC power. </p>
