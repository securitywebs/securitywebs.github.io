<p>In the past, a surveillance security system typically consisted of several cameras connected-- either hardwired or wireless-- to a digital video recorder (DVR), which tape-recorded the images and showed them on a closed circuit tv (CCTV) or monitor. Nowadays, it's much easier to have a standalone security camera. Whether you have one camera or numerous, they deal with your home's internet network to send footage right to your computer or mobile phone.

Some designs utilize your existing keyed cylinder and deadbolt hardware and connect to the within your door, while others require that you remove your existing exterior and interior escutcheons and replace the deadbolt and strike hardware.</p>

This kind of wireless communication works the exact same method as your mobile phone and counts on a cellular signal. If you live in a rural area where the cell signal is spotty, this feature may not be readily available, however you need to verify with the company just to make sure.</p>
