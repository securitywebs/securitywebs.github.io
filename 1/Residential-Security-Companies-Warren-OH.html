<p>Likewise called eyeball" cameras, the turret camera has a ball-and-socket joint to let you precisely reroute the field of vision without remounting the security camera every time. They're excellent for warehouses. A few of these may look like dome cameras, however there's an easy trick to distinguish them - if the lens and the IR LEDs remain in front of the glass on the real estate rather than consisted of behind it, you have actually got a turret camera rather of a dome.</p>
