<p>Recently, Ring rejected reports that it had suffered a data breach, but we agree with its suggestion that users need to reset passwords and allow two-factor authentication as a preventive measure.

If you prepare to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially check out the What about Ring? area from our clever video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it concerns video products, we do not believe that these problems modify the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain confident in our existing recommendation.</p>
