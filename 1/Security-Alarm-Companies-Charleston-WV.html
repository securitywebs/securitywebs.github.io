<p>One of the top home security service providers since going into the business in 1992, Protect America supplies service for numerous thousands of customers around the United States and Canada. They offer versatility in their equipment and offered strategies, permitting house owners to pick the security service that best fits their needs. Sadly, there are some disadvantages to Secure America indicated by their low C- ranking from BBB. A majority of the problems center around false information regarding the necessary three year contract. In truth, a lot of customers were not mindful they were making such a long term commitment.
