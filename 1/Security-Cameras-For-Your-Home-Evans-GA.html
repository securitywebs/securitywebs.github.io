When a patient pushes the emergency button, it sends double signals: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Furthermore, if the central patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the danger and, if needed, might simply press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular flooring.</p>

So why isn't it a pick? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, mobile phone alerts and live views were painfully sluggish, and the range is bad. Likewise, if the camera is in the middle of recording, don't anticipate to get a live peek or make any settings modifications-- it can't multitask.</p>
<p>The disadvantage to a wireless system is that it relies on a wireless signal, indicating that storms and strong winds have the power to interrupt the system and might even activate false alarms. False alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might lead to fines from the provider or the police if they take place often enough. Another prospective downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment should be changed or charged regularly in order to keep the system working.
