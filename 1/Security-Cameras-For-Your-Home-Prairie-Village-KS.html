<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a harmful aggressor, because the interruption of the network avoids the circulation of data and actually indirectly secures information by preventing it from being sent. The normal factor for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, offering a chance for the harmful enemy to tape these codes and utilize different splitting tools to evaluate security weak points and exploit them to get unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools readily available which can release a dictionary style attack of "perhaps accepted" security keys based upon the "model" security key caught throughout the network recovery.</p>
