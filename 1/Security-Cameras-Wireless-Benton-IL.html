<p>A subsidiary of Amazon, Ring's Alarm security kit fasts to install and easy to use.

<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
<p>We likewise love that Ring still has decent clever home support. Some other cheap security systems, like SimpliSafe and Cove, do not work so well with clever home gadgets like lights and locks. Ring Alarm supports Z-Wave, so you can integrate your clever outlets with your total security system. Wireless keypads and keychains so you can manage your alarm system from anywhere inside or near your business. </p>
