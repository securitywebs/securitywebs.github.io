<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously excellent piece of innovation. For beginners, it looks gorgeous: the all-white design and black camera face are seriously spacey (if eerily reminiscent of the AI in 2001: An Area Odyssey). When you picture a home security camera, it's far from the horrid metal CCTV box that you might call to mind.

In many cases, Geographic Details Systems technology is used to precisely assess criminal activity patterns for camera placement; however, the positioning of cameras can likewise be the outcome of input from policeman and other criminal justice stakeholders (La Vigne et al. 2011).</p>

Some models can even tell the difference in between a passing car, an animal, and an individual. Search for an outdoor camera that will incorporate with other clever home devices such as garage door openers, external sirens, and wise switches.</p>
