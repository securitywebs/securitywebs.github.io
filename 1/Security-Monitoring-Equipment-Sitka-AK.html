<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest).

We think that's costly.</p>

<h3>Basic Home Alarm System in Sitka AK</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
