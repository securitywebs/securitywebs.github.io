<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between people and general motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
