<p>Really simply, the person at the door presses the button. You'll get an alert to your phone (you can also get a Ring Chime WiFi extender if you desire a doorbell sound too.) The camera then streams a video-link to your phone (or Amazon Echo Show, if you have among those) - and given that it works as an intercom, you can then have a chat with the person at the door if you so desire.

<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by an expert home security company. When the system detects a break-in, fire, or other emergency, it alerts the security group and, in many cases, emergency responders.

And with video innovation most likely to continue advancing, the lack of any clear borders for what CCTV systems should have the ability to do postures a considerable threat.</p>
