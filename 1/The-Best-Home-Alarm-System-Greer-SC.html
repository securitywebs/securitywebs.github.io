Wireless Security Systems use local hard disk drive, cloud storage, or a mix of the 2 in place of video footage used by landline systems.

<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents speaking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are fairly typical. If a homeowner forgets their keys and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is activated by a community cat, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the homeowner will be called by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it quickly. Incorrect alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a house owner won't receive calls from a monitoring company. Instead, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>
