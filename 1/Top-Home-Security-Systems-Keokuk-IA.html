<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.

The app is slick and great, enhancing the camera's own cool design, and you can control the Circle through Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit or among Logitech's Pop smart home buttons.</p>
