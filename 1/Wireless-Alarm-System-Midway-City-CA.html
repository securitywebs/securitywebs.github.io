<p>Nevermind how fantastic the cameras are. The very first question you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your data to third party companies?

Note that these sirens might break local noise control laws, so inspect ahead of time prior to making the purchase.</p>
<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>
