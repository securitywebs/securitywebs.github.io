The smart bit is that the camera not just identifies that people have entered its 130-degree visual field, however it will likewise have a stab at recognising them too.

<h2>Wireless Security Camera And Receiver Systems Champaign</h2>
<p>I have this camera attached to my desktop computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able place the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my corridor. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which was able to find the camera without problem. The IR lights at night are able to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the price and it doesn't eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
