<h3>Home Security And Alarm Systems in Florida</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually discovered that battery life never ever matches the producer's stats considering that this comes from tests in a regulated environment without continuous video recording, which is the biggest culprit for short battery life by far.

<p>Just recently, Ring rejected reports that it had suffered an information breach, however we agree with its recommendation that users need to reset passwords and make it possible for two-factor authentication as a preventive measure. All smart-home gadgets are susceptible to such events. Nevertheless, after this newest entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have actually chosen to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially check out the What about Ring? area from our clever video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video products, we do not think that these problems change the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay positive in our current recommendation.</p>
