<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to check in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We initially discovered Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it quickly became a personnel (and friends and family) favorite. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send out informs, you can't control it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
<p>This self monitored alarm has four smart modes-- Home, Away, Night, and Private. Based upon that, the camera turns on or off depending upon your location. The camera records 1080p videos with a 147-degree wide angle lens that lessens all blind spots and offers you access to a broader field of vision than a lot of cameras. It is also geared up with a 3x digital zoom function that permits you to zoom in and capture details such as facial features in case of burglaries.</p>
