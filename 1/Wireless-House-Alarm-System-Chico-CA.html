<p>Xfinity Home Refund Policy for Pre-Payments: If you make a pre-payment prior to installation of your Xfinity Home service, such pre-payment will be applied as a credit to charges due on the following month's expense from Comcast. In the event you cancel your Xfinity Home service, your pre-payment will be applied instead to any other charges due on your bill for Comcast services. You will not receive a cash or credit card refund of your pre-payment. However, if all of your services from Comcast are disconnected, or if Comcast is otherwise required under applicable law to refund the pre-payment, Comcast will, within forty-five (45) days or as otherwise specified by relevant law, return an amount equal to the pre-payments your made (without interest unless otherwise required by law) minus any quantities due on your account (consisting of, without constraint, any quantities owed for any services or for any equipment that is harmed, altered or not returned).</p>

There are companies out there like Frontpoint that are known to be particularly helpful in this phase.</p>
