<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when consumers recognize that the economical consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
