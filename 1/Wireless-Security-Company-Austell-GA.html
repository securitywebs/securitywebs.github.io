<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
