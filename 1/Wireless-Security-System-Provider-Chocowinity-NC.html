Screens can be connected to the DVR for viewing, or the system can be set up to interact via network or mobile app for seeing.</p>
<p>IP security cameras capture analog images and transform them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing capabilities like compression and motion detection. The captured digital video stream is then broadcast over a local area network (LAN) utilizing Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which records each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and review.
