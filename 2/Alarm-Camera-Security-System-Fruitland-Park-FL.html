<p>What truly sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be pricey but is essential. In reality, we do not recommend buying this camera at all unless you prepare to include the subscription.

Being able to distinguish between a cars and truck and a person, for example, allows you to minimize unneeded signals. And Activity Zones are a nice perk, specifically if you're seeking to monitor a particular corner of the yard, an entrance, or perhaps trash bin. </p>
