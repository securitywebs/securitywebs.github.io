<p>Unmonitored alarm: These alarms create a loud sound that is within both audible and outside the home. While they may terrify a burglar away, the downside is that nobody will be called to pertain to your home, and you will have to call emergency situation services yourself. However, alarm pros state having an unmonitored system is still much better than having no security system at all.</p>
