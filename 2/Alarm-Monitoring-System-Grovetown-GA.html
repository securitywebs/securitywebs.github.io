<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
<p>The passive infrared (PIR) motion detector is among the most typical sensing units found in household and small company environments. It offers trusted and economical performance. The term passive refers to the truth that the detector does not produce or radiate its own energy; it works entirely by detecting the heat energy emitted by other objects. </p>
