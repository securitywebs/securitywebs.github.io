If a consumer has a lodged a grievance about the company, its staff, or its equipment, it will be on that website. Other third-party reviews websites should be checked also. Consider asking next-door neighbors for recommendations on security systems too. They may even suggest a local company with a strong track record that can expertly install the equipment.</p>
