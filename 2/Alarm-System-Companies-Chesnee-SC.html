<p>Wireless systems, on the other hand, often utilize battery-powered transmitters which are simpler to install and have less expensive start-up costs, but might fail if the batteries are not maintained. Depending on range and building materials, several wireless repeaters may be needed to bring the signal to the alarm panel reliably. A wireless system can be transferred to a new home quickly, a benefit for those who rent or who move regularly. The more vital wireless connection for security is the one in between the control board and the monitoring station. Wireless monitoring of the alarm system secures against a burglar cutting a cable television or from failures of an internet provider. This complete wireless setup is commonly described as 100% wireless.</p>
<p>Select specific features that match your situation. For example, if you experience frequent power outages, a security system that uses battery back-up would be an useful choice.
