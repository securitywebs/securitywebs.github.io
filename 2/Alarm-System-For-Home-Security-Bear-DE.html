<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software to identify it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only a false sense of security because it prevents just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
