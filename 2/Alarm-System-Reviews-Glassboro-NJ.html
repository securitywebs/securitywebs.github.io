<p>Simply put, security doorbells are simply small security cameras - wired or wireless - that consist of a door buzzer and a 2-way intercom in the frame. Combining the advantages of a security camera and an intercom provides you a large range of powerful features to secure your home or business.

And Activity Zones are a good perk, specifically if you're seeking to monitor a particular corner of the lawn, a doorway, or perhaps trash bin. </p>
