<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that compare individuals and general motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
<p>A system that requires an agreement may be a smart option for those who are cash-strapped or don't want to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Due to the fact that contract-based security systems typically don't come with in advance fees. Rather, the costs are spread out over the length of the agreement. We've seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we suggest contract-free systems if you do not wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting arrangement (and who does?). Our pick: No agreement.</p>
