<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has plainly attempted to offer it an attractive edge, and we need to offer credit to its capability to reveal what's going on from as much as 4 cameras at a time. It can be slow and uncomfortable to use on celebration - with the process of linking to the camera for a live view rather languid at times. The previous, less expensive variation of the outdoor Nest cam is still on sale too if you wish to save some cash - it does have a cable television connected however, instead of working wirelessly, which suggests it's a bit simpler to mess up for potential trespassers.
