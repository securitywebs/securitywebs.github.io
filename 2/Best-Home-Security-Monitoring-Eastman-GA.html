On the easier side, with SimpliSafe, you trade the bells and whistles of wise home equipment for versatility and low prices. SimpliSafe does have a video doorbell with two-way audio, but you can't include a lots of other clever home tech to the system. It will not work with loads of clever home equipment from other companies. The app is extremely impressive, and while the level of control does not match SmartThings, creating 'Actions' - such as turning the hall light on when you open the front door, or turning up the heat when you trip the motion sensing unit in the early morning - are refreshingly easy.</p>
<p>When choosing in between home security companies, who you select matters.

<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were outstanding in our testing-- during the day and during the night-- with a large, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We ought to note that the camera would occasionally downgrade the picture quality based on offered bandwidth, which might fluctuate throughout the day. Nest includes the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that may defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
