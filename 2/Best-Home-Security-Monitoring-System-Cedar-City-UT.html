<p>Are independently owned, operated surveillance cameras to be treated the same way as public cameras? We also need to draw fine lines about 'Who really is viewing you'?

The camera could lawfully do what a peeping tom could refrain from doing. They could peer within windows with the complete protection of the law on their side. If an individual was standing enjoying outside a window it could be a criminal offense, yet the same individual could position a surveillance camera then remotely see an individual within the privacy of their home. Most significantly, it is not against the chastening code.</p>
