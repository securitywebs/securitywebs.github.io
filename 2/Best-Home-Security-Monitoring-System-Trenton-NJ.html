<h3>Security System House in Trenton NJ</h3>
<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously impressive piece of innovation. For starters, it looks stunning: the all-white style and black camera face are seriously spacey (if strangely similar to the AI in 2001: A Space Odyssey). When you picture a home security camera, it's far from the horrid metal CCTV box that you might call to mind.

At Smith Thompson Security we believe the best thing to do is, is to show you the price of the equipment and monitoring rate individually. That way you REALLY understand what you're investing. Even if you take advantage of our 12 months same as money financing option, when it's settled, all you have left is our low month-to-month monitoring rate.</p>
