Additionally, house owners can publish decoy alarm indications and fake CCTVs.</p>
<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it offers protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software application to find it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just an incorrect complacency given that it prevents just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
