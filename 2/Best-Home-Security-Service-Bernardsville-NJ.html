<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a harmful attacker, since the interruption of the network prevents the flow of information and in fact indirectly safeguards data by avoiding it from being transferred. The usual reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, offering an opportunity for the harmful attacker to record these codes and utilize various cracking tools to evaluate security weak points and exploit them to get unauthorized access to the system.

<p>Are privately owned, operated surveillance cameras to be treated the exact same way as public cameras? We likewise need to draw fine lines about 'Who really is watching you'? 'Who owns that camera anyway'? Big bro? The Corporates? Or pestering neighbour? Who fixes a limit between public interest and harassment? At the moment, no one! The camera might legally do what a peeping tom could refrain from doing. They might peer inside of windows with the full protection of the law on their side. If a person was standing seeing outside a window it might be a criminal offense, yet the exact same person could position a surveillance camera then remotely see an individual within the personal privacy of their home. Most significantly, it is not against the penal code.</p>
