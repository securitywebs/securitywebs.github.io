<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the large amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at really fast speeds, and typically over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trustworthy, but not compatible with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for additional wiring.

Wireless security cameras may need less electrical wiring in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera separately, typically via 110VAC power. </p>
