Automatic dialer alarms are not permitted to dial 9-1-1.</p>

<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear video in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video in the dark is a top priority.</p>
