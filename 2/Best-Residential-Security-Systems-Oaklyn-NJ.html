The smart bit is that the camera not only finds that individuals have actually entered its 130-degree visual field, but it will likewise have a stab at identifying them too. Maybe more usefully, if someone passes who the camera does not understand, you get an alert about an "unknown face".

Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we do not suggest it since its battery-saving routines can disrupt efficiency.</p>
