No-contract systems, which enable you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than dedicating to a long-term arrangement, are becoming more typical. These systems in some cases cost more in advance for the hardware than pro systems that use a discount rate in exchange for that lengthy service contract. Paying for the equipment up front offers you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. And you can start and stop the monitoring service as many times as you desire.</p>
