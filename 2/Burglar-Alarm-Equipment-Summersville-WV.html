<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize people the camera is identifying utilizing face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those people and will send smart device informs with that info when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a nearby TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a wider variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
