<p>Because the glass housing does not get in the way, they aren't rather as vandal-proof as dome cameras, but they make up for it in abilities. Along with being great for re-positioning on the fly, they are better for infrared and low-light because the glass real estate does not restrain the lens. With some, it's hard to tell at a look where they've been aimed, so they can provide a panoptic impression as a deterrent, despite their real field of view. Setting up a video surveillance system with a few of these is a fantastic choice for a variety of different configurations.</p>

<h3>Safe Home Security System in New York</h3>
<p>This system employs an electro-magnetic field disturbance principle based on 2 unshielded (or 'leaky') coaxial cables buried around 30 cm (1 ft) deep and 1 m (10 feet) apart. 6 The transmitter emits constant Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable television and the energy is received by the other cable television. When the modification in field strength deteriorates due to the existence of an item and reaches a pre-set lower limit, an alarm condition is generated. The system is concealed after installation. Care must be taken to ensure the surrounding soil provides good drain in order to prevent annoyance alarms.</p>

<p>Several other designs were disqualified due to performance concerns. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also plagued with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips. The Logitech Circle 2 (cordless) kept us waiting (approximately 30 seconds) to link to a live peek, often buffered, and had a reset function that left spaces of as much as 90 seconds in between videos.</p>
