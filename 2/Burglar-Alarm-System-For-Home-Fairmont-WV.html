I called their customer support team and they acknowledged that the sales people do not have to discuss it, it's on you to read the small print. I'm paying the swelling amount, due to the fact that obviously they car restore you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send out in a composed not by mail.

<p>The hermetically sealed reed switch is a very typical kind of 2 piece sensor that operates with an electrically conductive reed switch that is either typically open or normally closed when under the influence of an electromagnetic field as in the case of proximity to the 2nd piece which contains a magnet.

This action coupled with an electrical current (usually at 12V DC) allows an alarm control panel to find a fault on that zone or circuit. These type of sensors are extremely typical and are discovered either wired straight to an alarm control board, or they can normally be found in wireless door or window contacts as sub-components.</p>
