<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations.

As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when clients recognize that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
<p>Equipment consists of things like your windows and door sensing units, motion sensing units, control panel, and so on.

That stated, it can run cheaper if you choose a company that runs a lot of deals on equipment (like Frontpoint). </p>
