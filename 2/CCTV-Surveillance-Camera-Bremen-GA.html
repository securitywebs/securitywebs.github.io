This camera provides a wide variety of features consisting of a 360-degree swiveling base. Last time I reviewed a Swann camera I described it as distinctly middle of the road.

And Activity Zones are a great perk, particularly if you're seeking to monitor a specific corner of the yard, a doorway, or even trash bin. </p>
