<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a harmful opponent, since the disturbance of the network avoids the flow of data and really indirectly secures data by avoiding it from being transferred. The normal factor for performing a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, providing an opportunity for the destructive assaulter to tape-record these codes and utilize different splitting tools to evaluate security weak points and exploit them to get unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools available which can launch a dictionary style attack of "potentially accepted" security keys based on the "model" security essential captured during the network recovery.</p>
<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it offers protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software application to detect it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just a false complacency given that it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
