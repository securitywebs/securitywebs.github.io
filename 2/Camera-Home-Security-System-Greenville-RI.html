We love that the system includes a wifi security camera and just alerts you when motion is produced by something with the exact same heat pattern as a human (making sure there's no incorrect notifies). Nevertheless, you do need to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 per month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get informs on your phone if the sensors have been activated.
