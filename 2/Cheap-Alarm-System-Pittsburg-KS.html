<p>The cover of darkness isn't adequate to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does become a little a problem is between finding and recording motion.

<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it provides protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to detect it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just a false complacency since it avoids just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
