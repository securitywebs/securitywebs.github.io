<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were excellent in our screening-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a wide, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We ought to keep in mind that the camera would occasionally downgrade the image quality based on available bandwidth, which might fluctuate throughout the day.
