<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between people and general motion. We believe that's costly.</p>

If you're not mechanically inclined, having actually a professional set up the system might offer you more self-confidence than if you did the work yourself. Wireless cameras can't have all of it-- watch things inside by day, and keep an eye on what's going on outside after dark. It rarely works.</p>
