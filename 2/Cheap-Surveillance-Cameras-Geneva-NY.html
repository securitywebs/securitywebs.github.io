We also found the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a larger series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
