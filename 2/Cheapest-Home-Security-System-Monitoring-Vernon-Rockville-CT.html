<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids consulting with someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is activated. Let's face it, false alarms are fairly typical. If a house owner forgets their keys and returns within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is set off by an area feline, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the homeowner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it quickly. False alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a house owner won't receive calls from a monitoring company. Instead, homeowners access the alarm themselves and take the necessary action.</p>

<p>Unlike conventional burglar alarms, which have a control panel (typically situated in the entryway hall) that is utilized to arm and deactivate the alarm and alert you if any sensing units have been set off, wise alarms are managed from a smartphone app. The app lets you arm and deactivate the alarm, even if you've already left home, and informs you if any of the sensors have actually been activated, instead of getting home to find your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and potentially bothersome your neighbours).
