Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and functions are practically similar to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's plans are a little more expensive for the very same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation charges are burdensome, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer advise anyhow.</p>
