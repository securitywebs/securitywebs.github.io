Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and functions are practically similar to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's plans are a little more expensive for the very same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation charges are burdensome, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer advise anyhow.</p>
<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is top quality, if not especially groundbreaking, so we're actually advising the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free strategy option.

So choose what will be the better deal for you. Go with the agreement and reap those savings if you know you'll remain put for at least three years. However if you might upgrade to a new office with different security needs, contract-free is your best option.</p>
