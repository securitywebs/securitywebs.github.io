<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can identify people the camera is identifying utilizing face acknowledgment. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those individuals and will send out mobile phone alerts with that details when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to identify anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to determine faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a larger variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
