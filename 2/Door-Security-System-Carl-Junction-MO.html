We like that the system consists of a wifi security camera and just signals you when motion is produced by something with the exact same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no incorrect informs). Nevertheless, you do need to register for the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 each month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get informs on your phone if the sensing units have been activated.
