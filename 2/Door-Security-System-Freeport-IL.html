The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). Nevertheless, after almost two years of night, usage and day images have actually constantly been clear, and we never had issues with the camera missing out on motion, an issue we experienced when testing the Wyze Cam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a clever feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It creates a green, on-screen box around the motion identified.

<p>The big benefit is the 90dB alarm squeezed into a gadget that does not appear like a home security system. You can set the alarm off or contact emergency situation services direct from the app if you see a disturbance, and it rarely sends false signals due to the fact that it tracks your phone (and other family member's phones), so comprehends when you're at home and turns everything off. Similarly, it will arm itself automatically when everyone has actually left.</p>

Try to find an outdoor camera that will integrate with other smart home gadgets such as garage door openers, external sirens, and clever switches.</p>
