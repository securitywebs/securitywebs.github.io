<p>When using IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and frequently over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are dependable, however not suitable with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for additional electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may need less wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera separately, typically via 110VAC power. </p>
