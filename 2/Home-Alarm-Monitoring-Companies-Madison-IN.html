Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to detect any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to disregard objects that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires.
