<h3>Apartment Security System Wilton CT 06897</h3>
<p>The Blink XT2 is small, works on 2 AA batteries, and consists of a year's worth of complimentary cloud storage, and it catches a better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a pick? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, mobile phone alerts and live views were painfully sluggish, and the range is bad.

It costs a lot, its pricing isn't always transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to mention that the client service experience varies extensively depending on the dealer you choose. </p>
