<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific however good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.

We like that it likewise lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For many homes, you'll require a number of Minuts throughout your property, which can get pricey. It's likewise worth noting that it needs to be installed on the ceiling (it only keeps track of for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly. It likewise had the quietest alarm of all that we tested and there's no external monitoring service available.</p>
