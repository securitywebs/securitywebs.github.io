<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the exact same spot and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather.

Wireless security cameras may require less circuitry in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera independently, normally through 110VAC power. </p>
