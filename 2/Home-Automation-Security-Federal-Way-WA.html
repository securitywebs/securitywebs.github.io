<p>This system employs an electro-magnetic field disruption concept based upon 2 unshielded (or 'leaky') coaxial cables buried roughly 30 cm (1 feet) deep and 1 m (10 feet) apart. 6 The transmitter discharges continuous Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable and the energy is gotten by the other cable. When the modification in field strength deteriorates due to the presence of a things and reaches a pre-set lower limit, an alarm condition is generated. The system is hidden after installation. Care must be required to guarantee the surrounding soil uses good drainage in order to avoid problem alarms.</p>
<p>However monitored systems also tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey month-to-month cost for a set quantity of time, generally one to 5 years. No-contract systems, which allow you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis instead of committing to a long-lasting arrangement, are ending up being more common. These systems in some cases cost more in advance for the hardware than pro systems that use a discount in exchange for that prolonged service contract. Paying for the equipment in advance offers you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you utilize the service. And you can start and stop the monitoring service as sometimes as you desire.</p>
