<p>Absolutely nothing is more vital than protecting what you treasure most ... your household and home. You don't need to purchase a multi-million dollar surveillance system to watch on your property and possessions. In the event that your alarm system is set off, your home security system sends a wireless alert to the monitoring company where security specialists are waiting to respond by instantaneously connecting with you and if need be, the local medical, fire or cops authorities.</p>
<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids consulting with someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is activated. Let's face it, false alarms are fairly common. If a house owner forgets their keys and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is activated by a community cat, it can set off the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the homeowner will be gotten in touch with by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it quickly. False alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a house owner will not get calls from a monitoring company. Rather, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the essential action.</p>
