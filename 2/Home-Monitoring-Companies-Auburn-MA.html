When you're at home and do not desire to be recorded, the privacy-conscious will be pleased to hear there's a physical shutter you can close over the camera.</p>

<p>While some elements might be affected for a short while by a power blackout, cellular and landline systems will continue to work even if there's no electricity. Cellular systems use cell towers to communicate with the monitoring center along with a battery backup that can keep them up and running for a number of hours till the electrical service is brought back. Landline systems utilize standard phone lines to communicate with the monitoring center and, similar to cellular systems, they generally have a battery backup to keep them working for a set period of time.</p>
<p>The Kasa Cam Outdoor is a good well-rounded weatherproof home security camera that costs less than $100. However, there are a couple of tradeoffs with this camera.

<p>Whether you decide to opt for a DIY system or select an expertly installed system, you'll have to pay a regular monthly or yearly  fee if you need monitoring, and in some cases, you'll be hit with a monthly cost to pay off the cost of hardware components. With a lot of DIY systems, such as the SimpliSafe Home Security Package, the Ring Alarm Security Set, and the Nest Secure, you purchase the hardware outright and can prevent any month-to-month charges if you decide to self-monitor. If you include monitoring, charges will differ: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 each month for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 each month. If you devote to a three-year agreement, the rate of the Nest service drops to $19 per month. Ring's Protect Plus strategy opts for $10 monthly and doesn't require a contract.</p>

<p>Expenses for systems vary. Bigger systems that provide full-house protection with professional monitoring are the most expensive choices. Smaller, self-monitored systems are the most budget-friendly choice. Keep in mind that cameras with two-way audio normally work like walkie talkies.

And while this is a quite basic feature in indoor cameras, two-way audio is fairly uncommon in outdoor security cameras.</p>
