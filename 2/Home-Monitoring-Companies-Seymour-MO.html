<p>Whether you're utilizing a wireless IP-based system or sign up for a security component as a part of a "clever home" package; these innovations rely on user passwords to arm and deactivate them. To keep these gadgets secure, it's recommended that customers frequently change their passwords and never ever share them with individuals outside the household.

As more recent security systems transition to cloud-based, wireless platforms, it is essential to guard yourself against network intrusion simply as you would with protecting your identity and virtual possessions online.</p>

<p>Because it's more complex than it needs to be, we do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, alerts, and integration all need separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days.
