<p>Six basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Possession protection gadgets are developed to safeguard specific, tangible properties, such as jewelry, paintings, cash boxes, and family treasures. These gadgets can be equipped with anti-tampering innovation to avoid being disarmed.

<p>Some house owners post decoy alarm indications hoping they'll hinder possible robbers. These signs may be attached to a front door, a popular window, published in the front yard, or at the top of a driveway.

This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools offered which can release a dictionary style attack of "possibly accepted" security secrets based upon the "design" security crucial caught during the network recovery.</p>
