<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most highly innovative outdoor camera we have actually evaluated. It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically focuses on motion and then follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high vibrant range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare general motion and people, so it reduces incorrect alarms, and it can even recognize individuals you have actually identified (after a knowing period). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can recognize people the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to recognize those individuals and will send out mobile phone notifies with that info when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
