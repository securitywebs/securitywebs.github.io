<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal since the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as customers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
