<h2>Internet Home Alarm Monitoring Union</h2>

In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls must be validated, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires verification from a personal security guard. A number of cities likewise require a license to even own and run a home security system.

<p>It depends on the size and layout of the monitoring and the home goals. The benefits of cameras are that you can get visual verification of any activity happening inside or outside the home.
