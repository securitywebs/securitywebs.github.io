<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that compare people and general motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
