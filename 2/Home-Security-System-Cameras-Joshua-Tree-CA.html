<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally normal because the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone going into the store.
