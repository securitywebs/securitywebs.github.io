<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely typical because the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
