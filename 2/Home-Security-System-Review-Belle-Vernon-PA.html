<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a lit up room.
