<p>We have all heard that old saying, you get what you spend for". If you're looking for a robust DVR system that feels premium and records in 2K quality, this model from Samsung Wisenet will fit the bill. It ships with four white and streamlined bullet-style cameras developed for indoor and outdoor usage.

Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint doesn't have a contract, and its equipment pricing is extremely reasonable, so it's not an overall splurge. However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the similarity Vivint or Brinks.</p>

Both the original Abode system and the House Iota work with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, but the Iota is the only model we checked that likewise works with HomeKit.
