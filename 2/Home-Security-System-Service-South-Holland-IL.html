<p>When integrated with face recognition, surveillance camera networks raise extra personal privacy and civil liberties issues-- particularly due to the fact that face recognition information is prone to mistake.

<p>So far so normal. Things start to get truly intriguing with the Nest's facial acknowledgment system. If the camera spots a face it does not acknowledge, it will send a notification and image to your phone, allowing you to give that individual the twice. If it's someone getting up to no good, the camera will follow their motions and save the timestamp, so you can easily discover it in the future.

<p>Another benefit to monitored systems is if you acquire a monitored security plan, the same company that keeps an eye on the system will install it for you.

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the large amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are dependable, but not compatible with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for more circuitry. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera separately, usually via 110VAC power. </p>
