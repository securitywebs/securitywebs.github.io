<p>The Piper NV is firstly a camera. It provides night vision and a wide-angle view so you can utilize one camera to monitor a big space. Through the mobile app, you can stream live video footage of your home or perhaps use two-way audio to interact with others. If Piper finds motion or sound, it will alert you through text, push notification, e-mail, or phone call. In truth, you can even use all four methods at the very same time.</p>
<p>The density of access points can even be a problem - there are a limited number of channels offered, and they partly overlap. Each channel can manage multiple networks, however places with numerous personal wireless networks (for example, apartment complexes), the restricted number of Wi-Fi radio channels may cause slowness and other issues.</p>

The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after practically two years of day, use and night images have always been clear, and we never had problems with the camera missing motion, a problem we encountered when evaluating the Wyze Camera Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a smart feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It develops a green, on-screen box around the motion discovered. We have actually seen it highlight cars and trucks, moths, and mice.</p>

<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see during the night. If recording footage in the dark is a concern, make certain your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
