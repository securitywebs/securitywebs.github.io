Each channel can manage multiple networks, however places with numerous personal wireless networks (for example, apartment complexes), the restricted number of Wi-Fi radio channels may cause slowness and other issues.</p>

We have actually seen it highlight cars and trucks, moths, and mice.</p>

<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see during the night. If recording footage in the dark is a concern, make certain your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
