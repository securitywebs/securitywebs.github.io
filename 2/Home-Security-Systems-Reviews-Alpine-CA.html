<p>First and foremost, it's tough to dislike the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other picks, but it's better than a great deal of cameras that are four times the rate. The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). Nevertheless, after nearly 2 years of usage, day and night images have actually constantly been clear, and we never had issues with the camera missing motion, an issue we came across when evaluating the Wyze Cam Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a clever function you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It develops a green, on-screen box around the motion discovered.

Lots of companies offer package that include installation and a basic wireless system at a bargain if you sign up for their monitoring service. When you're feeling old-fashioned, you can control Vivint security with a keychain remote, the main control or a mobile app panel.</p>

We 'd most likely recommend a company like Vivint, ADT, or Frontpoint if you're beginning from scratch.</p>
