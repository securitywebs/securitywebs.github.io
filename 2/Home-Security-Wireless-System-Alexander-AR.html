All smart-home gadgets are susceptible to such occurrences. However, after this most current entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have actually decided to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially check out the What about Ring? section from our clever video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it concerns video products, we do not think that these problems change the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay positive in our existing suggestion.</p>
