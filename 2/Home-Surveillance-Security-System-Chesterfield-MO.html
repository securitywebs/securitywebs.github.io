<p>We do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complicated than it should be. Recordings, informs, and integration all need separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we typically found action missing, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
