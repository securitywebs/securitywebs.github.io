<p>Think of it by doing this, if a good still-camera costs a minimum of 2 hundred and fifty dollars (US $), how can a more advanced camera be sold for the low price of forty dollars? It simply does not add up. To offer such low prices, manufacturers must cut corners, and completion result is jeopardized performance. What good is a surveillance camera that just works ideally in ideal conditions like bright sunlight? Consumer-grade cameras can work well in particular circumstances such as nanny cameras or checking in on a family pet, though when looking to collect proof of a crime they often come up short.</p>
<p>There are two main kinds of cameras that can be wired into a video surveillance system: web protocol (IP) cameras and the traditional analog cameras. IP cameras are the more modern-day iteration of analog cameras, and while the individual cameras tend to be a little bit more expensive, they offer a number of functions that analog cameras do not. Here's a look at the distinctions between the 2 kinds of camera.</p>

(A four-camera pack expenses $504.72 at the time of composing.) But we can't fault Arlo excessive for that-- any top quality multi-camera system is going to strike your wallet hard.</p>
