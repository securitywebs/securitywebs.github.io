<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky.

Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>
