<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trusted, but not suitable with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for additional wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less circuitry in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera individually, typically through 110VAC power. </p>
