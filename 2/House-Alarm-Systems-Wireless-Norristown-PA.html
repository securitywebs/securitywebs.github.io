<p>If there's one company challenging ADT's lawn indication monopoly, it's Xfinity Home Security The multi-platform company initially explored home security in 2011, and its signature red yard indication is nearly as ubiquitous as ADT's classic blue.

<h3>Alarm System For Home Security in Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>Ring may not be the most innovative system on our list (Vivint takes that prize), however it sure has actually acquired quite the excitement over the years. We have actually been testing Ring Alarm a fair bit recently, and we actually like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a packaged security kit that offers basic intrusion protection with super-low monthly monitoring fees. Or ... no monitoring fees at all if you pick the complimentary self-monitor" choice.</p>
<p>AFA Protection Systems Inc. uses Honeywell and DMP home security equipment. Systems are professionally set up and included a 12-month contract.

<p>Rates - Basic packages are $249.50 for the equipment and $29.00 monthly for monitoring. The upper-tier proposition is $299.50 for the equipment and $39.00 per month. There is a 30-day danger totally free return offer, in addition to a 2-year warranty. While these are clearly reasonable prices, some care is needed. There have actually been many negative reviews and grievances relating to misleading marketing and bad customer service.

So, make sure you know what you're getting into before you sign the dotted line.</p>
<p>So why don't we rank ADT higher? In some ways, ADT irritates us. We see so many growing companies branching out and attempting new things in the home security space. But ADT isn't maintaining. It costs a lot, its rates isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to point out that the customer support experience differs extensively depending upon the dealership you choose. </p>
