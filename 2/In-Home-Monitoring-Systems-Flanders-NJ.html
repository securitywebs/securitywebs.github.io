When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>

When a patient presses the emergency situation button, it sends dual notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Additionally, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the danger and, if needed, might merely push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>
