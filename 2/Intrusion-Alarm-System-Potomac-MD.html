<p>For these separate systems to assemble or to integrate them together into a single interface, an in-depth knowledge of all the required systems is required. If there are no as-built documents providing performance and setup details to make this combination work, there are only two choices. The very first option, which may be the most complex, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original option provider is reluctant or unavailable to provide those information) and document the geography and how they can be included into the new DVS system.
