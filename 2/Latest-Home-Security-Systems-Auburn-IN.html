Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing out on, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
