We are verifying with Arlo whether our system was defective, and so we might revisit this review.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion activates.</p>
