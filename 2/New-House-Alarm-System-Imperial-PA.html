<p>Everything Vivint does, it does well. Where other alarm companies offer a collection of third-party equipment, Vivint styles its own things. Where some choices, like ADT, have good equipment but so-so cameras, Vivint's cameras have some of the very best functions on the market, consisting of video analytics and 4K image sensing units (in addition to more basic fare like motion detectors, two-way audio, and night vision).</p>

Like the Arlo Pro 2, the Blink system also includes a sync module that links to WiFi rather than utilizing an ethernet cable to attach to your router, making things a bit easier.

<h3>Security House Alarms Imperial PA 15126</h3>
<p>Vivint's monitoring charges remain in line with our other top security companies, which is excellent offered the sophisticated proprietary equipment and services that include a Vivint home security system. We also like that Vivint provides you the option to buy your equipment outright, which implies you're off the hook for a long-term agreement-- but that does require a large up-front payment.</p>
<p>What to consider: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 monthly, however you'll pay a little bit more if you want to include extra functions, like a security camera. While a normal agreement runs 42 months (one of the longer contract terms on our list), that requirement is only for users who want to lease their equipment. If you buy your equipment upfront, Vivint has no minimum agreement requirement.</p>
<p>So what takes place if something triggers your alarm but you're in a conference with a supplier and you don't get the alert? Or what if you've finally gone on a much-needed holiday and your spotty cell service indicates you do not get alerted until the next day? If your system equipment consists of an audible alarm, the noise might frighten potential burglars-- if you're fortunate. However the authorities won't come until you personally call them. </p>
