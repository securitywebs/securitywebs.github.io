It normally involves connecting video cameras to an IP network or taping gadget and monitoring the feed.</p>

This alternative is generally cost-free. A cloud storage alternative conserves your video in the cloud. Nevertheless, this is normally a paid service and the number of hours it will save will depend on how much cloud storage you are willing to pay for.</p>
