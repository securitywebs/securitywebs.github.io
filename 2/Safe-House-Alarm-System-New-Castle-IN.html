<p>Wireless systems, on the other hand, often use battery-powered transmitters which are easier to install and have more economical start-up expenses, but might stop working if the batteries are not kept. Depending upon range and building and construction products, several wireless repeaters may be required to bring the signal to the alarm panel reliably. A wireless system can be moved to a new home easily, a benefit for those who lease or who move regularly. The more important wireless connection for security is the one in between the control panel and the monitoring station.
