We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that compare people and general motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>

<p>Although it has a lot of versatility in placement, the Nest Camera Outdoor does require a source of power, so it should be put within reach of an outlet. This can be an issue outside the house.
