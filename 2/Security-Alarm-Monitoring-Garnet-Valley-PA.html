<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
<p>So why do not we rank ADT greater? In some ways, ADT frustrates us. We see so many growing companies branching off and attempting new things in the home security space. However ADT isn't maintaining. It costs a lot, its prices isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to point out that the customer support experience varies widely depending on the dealership you go with. </p>
