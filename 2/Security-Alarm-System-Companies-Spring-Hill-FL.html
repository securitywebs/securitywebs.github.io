<p>Are independently owned, operated surveillance cameras to be dealt with the very same method as public cameras? We also require to draw fine lines about 'Who truly is viewing you'? 'Who owns that camera anyway'? Big bro? The Corporates? Or bugging neighbour? Who draws the line between public interest and harassment? At the minute, no one! The camera might lawfully do what a peeping tom might refrain from doing. They could peer within windows with the full protection of the law on their side. If an individual was standing viewing outside a window it could be a crime, yet the same individual might place a surveillance camera then remotely see a person within the personal privacy of their home. Most notably, it is not against the penal code.</p>
