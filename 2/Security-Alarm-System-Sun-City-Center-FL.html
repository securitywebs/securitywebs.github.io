When a patient presses the emergency button, it sends dual signals: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS.

<p>Another factor to consider with wireless home security systems is the limited range of sensing units. The majority of radio frequencies are weak outside a range of 500 feet.

When seeking to buy a surveillance camera, there are a couple of elements to consider.</p>
<p>A self-monitored system needs to be clever. It should have the capability to follow guidelines with cause-and-effect relationships in between various devices. For instance, if carbon monoxide is discovered, you can produce a rule to turn your heating system off. Or you can develop another guideline that states if the front door is open, your security camera need to automatically begin tape-recording video footage. In doing so, it can potentially secure your home from flooding, fire, and even rapidly altering temperatures.</p>
