<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range".

As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
