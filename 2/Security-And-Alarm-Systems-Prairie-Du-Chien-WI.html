Some systems store recorded video locally on an SD card or a solid state drive, while others use cloud storage. In your area saved video is a good option for do-it-yourselfers on a budget, but you have to take care not to overwrite video you might need later. Cloud storage makes it easy to shop and access tape-recorded video, but it can cost hundreds of dollars per year depending on your membership.

Most especially, the local drive may fill - particularly if you tape everything. This implies that you can no longer save video footage till you offload some of the saved data.</p>
