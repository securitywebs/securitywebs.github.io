<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely regular considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once customers realize that the economical customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
