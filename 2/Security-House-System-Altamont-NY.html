Continue reading for 3 reasons Protect America is the best home security choice for lots of consumers.

<p>A system that needs an agreement may be a clever choice for those who are cash-strapped or don't want to spend for the equipment up-front. Why? Due to the fact that contract-based security systems normally do not included in advance fees. Rather, the expenses are spread out over the length of the contract. We've seen 1-year, all the method as much as 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you don't wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting agreement (and who does?). Our choice: No agreement.</p>
