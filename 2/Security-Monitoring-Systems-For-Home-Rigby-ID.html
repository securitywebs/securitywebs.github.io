<p>Any outdoor camera worth its salt must have the ability to endure direct exposure to the elements and need to carry an IP (Ingress Protection) ranking IP rankings consist of 2 digits that inform you simply how well the camera will hold up under the majority of climate condition. The very first digit following the IP prefix tells you how resistant the camera is to the ingress of solid things such as wind-blown dust and ranges from 0 (no protection) to 6 (overall protection against dust and dirt). The second number informs you how resistant the camera is to moisture and ranges from 0 (no protection) to 9 (protected against close quarters, high pressure spray downs from all angles).</p>
