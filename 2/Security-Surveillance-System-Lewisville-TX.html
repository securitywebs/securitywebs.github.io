If the system was not set up during the homebuilding procedure, setting one up may need drilling holes into walls, running new wires, patching drywall and getting to difficult areas that are sealed in attics or basements. Wired security systems are also vulnerable to power outages. Most will have a backup battery system that turns on in the event of a blackout, however long term outages will lead to the system losing power.
