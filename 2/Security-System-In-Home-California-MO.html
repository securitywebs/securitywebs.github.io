The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after practically 2 years of use, night and day images have always been clear, and we never had issues with the camera missing out on motion, a problem we encountered when evaluating the Wyze Web cam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a smart feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It produces a green, on-screen box around the motion found.
