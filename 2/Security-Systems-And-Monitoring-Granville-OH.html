<h3>Security Alarms For Houses Granville OH 43023</h3>

<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most technically sophisticated outdoor camera we've tested. It has a close-up tracking feature, which instantly zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare basic motion and individuals, so it cuts down on incorrect alarms, and it can even recognize individuals you have actually labeled (after a knowing period).
