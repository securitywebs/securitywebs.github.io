<p>Nevermind how excellent the cameras are. The first question you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your information to 3rd party companies? I have actually ditched my Nest Cams because they were purchased by Google. Something we all require to think about. Sirens. So your camera has actually discovered trespassers or wild animals. Do you want to terrify them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will do the trick. Note that these sirens may break local noise control laws, so check ahead of time prior to making the purchase.</p>
