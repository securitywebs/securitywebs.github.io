Wired security systems are also vulnerable to power interruptions. Many will have a backup battery system that switches on in case of a blackout, however long term failures will result in the system losing power.

<p>Unlike wired security systems, wireless systems permit on-the-go" monitoring of your system from a cellular phone - anytime, anywhere.

<p>The disadvantage to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, implying that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and could even activate false alarms. False alarms are understood to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might result in fines from the provider or the cops if they occur regularly enough. Another prospective downside to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment need to be replaced or charged routinely in order to keep the system working.
