I called their customer service team and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not have to discuss it, it's on you to check out the small print. I'm paying the swelling amount, due to the fact that apparently they vehicle restore you eventually unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send out in a composed not by mail.

If there are three select emergency exits, panic alarms, or door sensors, a single fixed camera can just watch one. This develops a one in three possibility of capturing a particular occurrence on video (either live or tape-recorded).

Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software application to spot it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false sense of security because it prevents just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
