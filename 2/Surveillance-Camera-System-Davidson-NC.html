<p>Absolutely nothing is more vital than protecting what you treasure most ... your household and home. You don't have to invest in a multi-million dollar surveillance system to keep an eye on your property and belongings. In the event that your alarm system is triggered, your home security system sends out a wireless alert to the monitoring company where security professionals are waiting to react by instantaneously connecting with you and if need be, the local medical, fire or cops authorities.</p>
<p>We didn't consider alarm systems that needed professional installation. Pro-installed systems typically cost more, use equipment comparable to that of Do It Yourself systems, featured long and typically burdensome contracts, and typically rely on the same monitoring companies that self-installed systems use, so they provide little advantage. A good example is the Vivint system, which we've evaluated independently and don't recommend for the majority of people.</p>
