<p>Security Camera Surveillance: You can choose to add a video camera and monitor to your system so you can capture thieves in the act if they do pick to get into your home. Or, you may wish to up the ante by installing a complex closed circuit tv (CCTV) which includes digital recorders, multiple operators, and a number of cameras. Some systems will also notify you by text if they detect anything, allowing you to visit on your smartphone to view the footage.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can recognize individuals the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those people and will send smartphone signals with that info when they show up at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to differentiate expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also supply a larger variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
