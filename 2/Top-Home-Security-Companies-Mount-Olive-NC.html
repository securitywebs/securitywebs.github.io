<p>The San Diego Cops Department intended to gain access to video footage from personal and public cameras in real time as part of the Operation Secure San Diego" surveillance program As of 2014, the program was filled with software compatibility issues, and officers had trouble viewing footage in real time because the department's patrol car did not have a 4G connection.

These companies developed their equipment by doing this to make customers stay with them longer, since switching monitoring companies suggests hundreds of dollars down the drain and a big headache for customers. Alexa assistance is included, as you would get out of an Amazon-owned brand name, and the camera competently handles all the normal functions when it concerns motion detection and two-way audio. Night vision is included too, for when the lights head out. </p>
