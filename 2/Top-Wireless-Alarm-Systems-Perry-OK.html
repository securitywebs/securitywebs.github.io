<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notices that compare people and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>
