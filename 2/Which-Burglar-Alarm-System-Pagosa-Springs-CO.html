<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, most alarm systems work the exact same way. They use open and closed circuits to move an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be transferred. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, unlocking allows for the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the alarm system will trigger.</p>

I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send out notifies, you can't manage it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
