<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally typical given that the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as consumers realize that the economical consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
