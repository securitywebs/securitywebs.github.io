<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely typical since the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once consumers understand that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
