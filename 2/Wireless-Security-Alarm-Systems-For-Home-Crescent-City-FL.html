<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it offers protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software application to find it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just an incorrect complacency because it prevents only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>

<p>For these separate systems to converge or to incorporate them together into a single user interface, a detailed understanding of all the needed systems is required. If there are no as-built files providing functionality and setup details to make this combination work, there are only two choices. The first alternative, which might be the most complex, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original option provider is unavailable or reluctant to provide those details) and document the topology and how they can be included into the new DVS system. The other approach is to rip and replace, performing a total upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to assemble them all.</p>
<p>What to consider: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 each month, but you'll pay a bit more if you wish to add additional functions, like a security camera.

Vivint has no minimum agreement requirement if you buy your equipment upfront.</p>
