Now, a lot of security systems include a multitude of elements, such as a base station, security camera, entry, motion, and glass break sensing units, a keypad, and key fobs, to name a few components.

<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to spot any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensing units to neglect items that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is installed to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
