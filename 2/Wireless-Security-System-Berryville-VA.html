<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that compare people and basic motion. We think that's costly.</p>
