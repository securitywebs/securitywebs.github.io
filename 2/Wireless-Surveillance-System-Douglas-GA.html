<h3>Wireless Home Security Alarm System in Georgia</h3>

<p>Yes. There are self-monitored systems that give access to a home's security app to approximately 20 family members. However, shared monitoring isn't a feature available from all companies.

Reacting to incorrect alarms can unnecessarily cost Sumner - and its taxpayers - cash each year. In addition, officers reacting to these false alarms are not able to respond to actual emergency situations or carry out preventative patrols.</p>
